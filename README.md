Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning
This project implements a hybrid BERT + BiLSTM model for sentiment analysis on textual data. The goal is to classify text into three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

🚀 Features
BERT embeddings for contextual word representation

BiLSTM for sequential learning

Multi-class sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

Trained on a balanced dataset of 15,000 text samples (5,000 per class)

Deployed using FastAPI for real-time inference

🧠 Model Architecture
BERT (Pretrained): For encoding sentences with contextual embeddings

BiLSTM Layer: For learning temporal dependencies

Dense + Softmax: For final sentiment classification

📁 Dataset
Source: GitHub-hosted dataset

Format: CSV

Structure:

text: Input sentence or phrase

label: Sentiment class (0 = Negative, 1 = Neutral, 2 = Positive)
